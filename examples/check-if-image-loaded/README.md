# Check If an Image Has Loaded

**Test Code**: [index.js](index.js)

**Tested Page**: [index.html](index.html)

This example shows how to check whether an image on the page has loaded.

The tested page requests an image from the server. The server responds with the image after a specified timeout.

If the image loads, the promise is resolved, otherwise it's rejected.

During the test, the `t.expect.ok` method waits for the promise to resolve and checks its result.
