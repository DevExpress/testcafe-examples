# Get Content From Multiple Elements

**Test Code**: [index.js](index.js)

This example shows how to extract text content from all items in an `<ul>` list.

`getTextFromElements` is a function that takes a TestCafe Selector as an argument and returns an array of strings: the `textContent` of each element that matches the `selector`.

The test checks if the resulting list matches an expected one.
